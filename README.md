what we choose the dataset roadmap for : Data Science = Exploration + Modeling


Before building models, it's essential to first understand the data.

Thatâ€™s where Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a key role.
It helps identify patterns, detect outliers and build strong data intuition.

ðŸ”¹ Univariate Analysis: Count, Mean, Median, Boxplots
ðŸ”¹ Bivariate Analysis: Correlation, Chi-square, Z-test, ANOVA

Once the data is well-understood, we move on to predictive modeling using:

- Classification

- Regression

- Clustering

- Association Rules


This structure forms the foundation of every well-executed data scienceÂ workflow.
